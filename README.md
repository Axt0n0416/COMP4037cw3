# AI in Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) – Literature Review (CW3)

This repository contains the literature collection and supplementary materials for the COMP4037 Coursework 3 (CW3), focusing on the application of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** in **Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs)**.

## 📚 Overview

The review includes 10 academic papers that explore:

- Machine learning-based routing in DTNs
- DTN protocols for emergency, rural, and space communications
- Integration of Random Forest, Neural Networks, and SDN concepts in DTN contexts

SurVis is used to organize and explore these papers interactively.
